/*
 * About this example
 *
 * 1. Start with initializing LEDC module:
 *    a. Set the timer of LEDC first, this determines the frequency
 *       and resolution of PWM.
 *    b. Then set the LEDC channel you want to use,
 *       and bind with one of the timers.
 *
 * 2. You need first to install a default fade function,
 *    then you can use fade APIs.
 *
 * 3. You can also set a target duty directly without fading.
 *
 * 4. This example uses GPIO18/19/4/5 as LEDC output,
 *    and it will change the duty repeatedly.
 *
 * 5. GPIO18/19 are from high speed channel group.
 *    GPIO4/5 are from low speed channel group.
